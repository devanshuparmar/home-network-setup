# Homelab Future Plans Documentation
# ------------------------------
# This script outlines the planned future enhancements for the homelab network setup.
# The enhancements aim to improve data storage, secure remote access, and comprehensive
# network integration and monitoring.

# ------------------------------
# 1. Hosting a NAS Solution for Centralized and Efficient Data Storage
# ------------------------------
echo "Planning for NAS solution integration"
# Purpose:
# - To provide centralized and efficient data storage, accessible by all network devices.
# - Improve data redundancy, sharing, and scalability.

# Planned Steps:
# - Select NAS software (e.g., TrueNAS, OpenMediaVault) and install on a dedicated VM or physical machine.
# - Configure storage pools and shares:
#   - Use ZFS or other RAID configurations for redundancy and performance.
#   - Create user permissions for secure access.
# - Integrate with existing network:
#   - Ensure network connectivity with OPNsense-managed network (20.0.0.0/24).
#   - Configure proper firewall rules for secure access.

# Additional Considerations:
# - Explore backup strategies (local and remote) to ensure data safety.
# - Implement access controls and encryption where necessary.

# ------------------------------
# 2. RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) Setup for Secure Remote Access
# ------------------------------
echo "Planning for RDP setup for secure remote access"
# Purpose:
# - To provide secure remote desktop access to devices within the homelab network.

# Planned Steps:
# - Select and install RDP server software on relevant devices (e.g., xrdp for Linux, Windows RDP).
# - Configure RDP access:
#   - Restrict access to authenticated users only.
#   - Use SSL/TLS encryption for secure communication.
# - Integrate with OPNsense firewall:
#   - Create NAT rules or VPN access for external RDP connections.
#   - Ensure that access rules are in place to protect against unauthorized access.

# Additional Considerations:
# - Consider using a VPN for secure external access to RDP sessions.
# - Monitor RDP connections for potential security breaches.

# ------------------------------
# 3. Access Point Configuration for Physical Device Integration
# ------------------------------
echo "Planning for access point configuration to route all physical devices through OPNsense"
# Purpose:
# - To fully integrate physical devices (e.g., laptops, mobile devices) into the 100.0.0.0/24 network.
# - Provide centralized network management and security via OPNsense.

# Planned Steps:
# - Configure an access point (AP):
#   - Use existing WiFi-capable hardware or a dedicated device.
#   - Connect the AP to the OPNsense LAN interface (100.0.0.0/24).
# - Adjust OPNsense settings:
#   - Ensure DHCP and DNS settings are properly configured for the new network segment.
#   - Apply firewall rules for secure device communication and isolation as needed.
# - Test and verify connectivity:
#   - Ensure all physical devices can connect through the access point and communicate with other network segments as expected.

# Additional Considerations:
# - Implement access controls, device whitelisting, and monitoring for security.
# - Optionally, set up guest networks for limited access.

# ------------------------------
# 4. SIEM Tool Integration for Enhanced Network Monitoring
# ------------------------------
echo "Considering SIEM tool integration for network monitoring"
# Purpose:
# - To enhance network security through centralized logging, event correlation, and threat detection.
# - Provide real-time insights into network activities and potential security incidents.

# Planned Steps:
# - Select a suitable SIEM tool (e.g., Splunk, ELK Stack, Wazuh).
# - Configure log collection:
#   - Collect logs from OPNsense, Plex, NAS, and other key services.
#   - Centralize log storage and enable event correlation.
# - Create and customize alerts:
#   - Configure alerts for suspicious activity, failed logins, or network anomalies.
#   - Integrate with other security measures (e.g., firewalls, IPS).

# Additional Considerations:
# - Ensure proper storage and archiving of logs to comply with security policies.
# - Regularly review and refine detection rules for evolving threats.
